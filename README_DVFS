CLOUDSIM wih DVFS tools
***********************


This version of CloudSim includes the DVFS tools.
The DVFS has been implemented in a 'DVFS' package, located in the 'power' package.
It allows to use the five common DVFS modes: performance, powersave, userspace, ondemand and conservative.

A new package called XML has also been added, and allow to define all the environment configuration: datacenter, hosts, vm, cloudlet and DVFS parameters.

Simple example of how to use this package are located in the folder: CloudSim_DVFS/src/modules/DVFS_Examples
There are two folders called 'Self_Description' and 'XML' contain examples. The first one does not use the XML package, and the second one uses the XML description.

In each example foler, a script allows to compile & launch them.

To compile examples, go to the example folder and use the following command line:
./Start_Experiment c

To launch examples, go to the example folder and use the following command line:
./Start_Experiment l

Output files examples are saved (by default) in the folder : $OUTPUT=/usr/local/share/OUTPUT_CLOUDSIM/$Date
